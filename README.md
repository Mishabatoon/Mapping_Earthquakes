# Mapping Earthquake

## Project Overview

This project shows the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates' location on the Earth.
Using `JavaScript`, `Leaflet.js`, `geoJSON data`, and `css`, we were able to generate a world map with the earthquake data. We also added tectonic plate data using `d3.json()`.

Using `Mapbox`, we added 4 different map styles that we can choose from:
* Streets Mode
* Satellite Mode
* Dark Mode
* Light Mode

There are 3 layers available to view on the map:
* Earthquake
*  Tectonic Plate
* Major Earthquakes

You can also use the indicator/legend on the lower right to analyze the magnitude level of the earthquakes. You can also click each marker to view the magnitude level and location of the earthquake.
